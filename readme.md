My goal with this project is to analyze a few US cities to determine how the weather enables going for a recreational walk.
My partner and I love going for walks, and while safety and walkability of a neighborhood influence this, weather does too!
Precipitation, temperature, humidity all make a difference in weather we can go for a walk any given hour or day. As we decide
where we want to settle down, I want to know which cities and climates give us the most annual walkability.
